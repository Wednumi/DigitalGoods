This application is an E-commerce platform for computer games and in-game attributes. The current state of the application is in the "refactor" branch. The application implements Clean (Onion) architecture, which is a software architecture pattern that separates the concerns of an application into layers that are isolated from each other.

The application uses EF Core with the Specification pattern for data access. This pattern allows for the creation of reusable query specifications that can be used to build complex queries. EF Core is a lightweight and extensible version of Entity Framework that provides an object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for .NET.

The front-end of the application is built using Blazor Server, which is a modern web framework for building interactive web user interfaces using C#. Blazor Server is a powerful and flexible framework that allows for the creation of rich and interactive web applications.

The application is designed to be scalable and maintainable, with a clear separation of concerns between the different layers of the application. This makes it easy to modify and extend the application as needed.

To get started with the application, simply clone the "refactor" branch and follow the instructions in the README file to set up the development environment. Once the development environment is set up, you can start exploring the code and making modifications to fit your specific needs.
